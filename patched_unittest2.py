'''
This is an extension of unittest2 to work with Michael Foord's totally awesome Mock library.

The basic idea is that you want to do lots of patching and have the UT
mostly take care of it for you. For example:

WRITEME (I just got started here...)

class Car(object):
    def __init__(self, make):
        self.make = make

    def get_make(self):
        return self.make

class Driver(object):
    def __init__(self, vehicle):
        self.vehicle = vehicle

    def is_driving_a(self):
        return self.vehicle.get_make()

class TestDriver(PatchedTestCase): pass
@TestDriver.patch.object(Car, 'get_make')
class TestDriver(PatchedTestCase):
    def postSetUpPreRun(self):
        self.mock_Car_get_make.return_value = sentinel.that_car

    def test_is_driving_a
